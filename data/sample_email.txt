Michael,

As requested, here's a summary of our exposure to the California energy crisis.
Our trading desk has taken significant positions in the California markets, and
we're seeing major volatility in prices. The regulatory uncertainty continues to
impact our forecasts.

Let me know if you need more details.

John
